            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas it hath pleaſed the Lord of Hoſts (who was called upon to decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of this Nation) to write his name upon your Sword in very legible eharacters, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears upon record twice, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year —45, where wee had 114 Victories, and now this laſt Summer above 30, even to our aſtoniſhment, who were uſed by you in that ſervice, that thoſe proud Billows in <hi>Wales, England,</hi> &amp; <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have bin bounded and calmed, in leſſe then ſix months, yet behold, we have our ſorrows repeated, and our fears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, making our wounds even to bleed afreſh.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, we deſire, in the name of our ſelves, and the abuſed and betrayed people of <hi>England,</hi> that your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will be pleaſed to aſſiſt us, in theſe enſuing requeſts and groans of our ſoules, which may not long be denyed us, leſt we faint or ſtruggle as we can for the life of good men, and a good Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:162508:3"/> 1. That juſtice may ſuddenly and equally be diſpenſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſires of our honoured friends in <hi>London, Lieceſterſhire,</hi> and others manifeſted by their ſeverall Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Parliaments Declaration concerning the Kings evill aſſerted, or bewayled, and repented of.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That your Army be inſtantly reckoned withall, &amp; paid and ſo dealt with for future (if they muſt be uſed) that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reg. may know their own country, &amp; there receive their pay immediatly, without any other Treaſurers or wayes of trouble, that ſo the people themſelves may ſee what they have for their money. In this we are impartent, or ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately affected, that we gaſp for help: this Regiment hath had but one moneths pay ſince <hi>May,</hi> having marched 1300 miles this Summer.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the people may know in print, with all ſpeed, which way all publike monies are diſpoſed of in all counties and places, and that of all kinds, which may be done, if every col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector and receiver of mony be forthwith enjoyned to print their receipts and disburſments; for if the ſouldiers be not paid, the people ask whats become of the Revenue, Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, Sequeſtrations, Exciſe, Lands, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Firſt, that the grand and capital enemies, may without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, be brought to Juſtice, which is the maine root of our miſery, we finding all other wayes attempted altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid to carry on this work of common ſafety.</p>
